  <h1>Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</h1>
    <p>As a result of a radioactive spider bite, high schooler Peter Parker 
  developed powers and abilities similar to that of a spider. 
  After Peter's selfishness indirectly resulted in the death of his beloved Uncle Ben, 
  Peter decided to live up to the motto that "With great power 
  there must also come great responsibility," 
  and thus became the superhero known as Spider-Man.</p>
